# Animal Facts

This is the group 5 project that includes Joseph C, Ngandala L, Scott M, and Kamel T.
The Project name is Animal Facts! The objective of this project is to give prospective
dog owners a place to search through different pictures of the specific dog breed that was
selected and to give them random facts about dogs to go along with them!


## User Story

AS A possible pet owner
I WANT to find pictures of different dog breeds and general information about dogs 
SO THAT I can make my decision on what dog breed I would like to get.
